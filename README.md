# SPLASH
This project provides a simplified interface for fetching images using the UNSPLASH API. 
Unsplash is a platform that offers high-quality, freely usable images. 
With this API integration, you can easily retrieve images based on the user input.

## Getting Started
1. Create an Unsplash developer account by visiting [Unsplash Developer](https://unsplash.com/developers).

2. Create a new application to obtain your API access key.
3. Once you have the API make sure to replace YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY in the JavaScript file:
```javascript
const apiKey = "YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY"
```

## Acknowledgments
